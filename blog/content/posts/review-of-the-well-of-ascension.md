The Well of Ascension is the second book in Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy, and it continues the story of Vin and Elend as they struggle to maintain control of Luthadel after the fall of the Lord Ruler.

This book explores themes of leadership, trust, and the nature of power. Sanderson's world-building continues to impress, and the magic system remains one of the most well-thought-out in fantasy literature.
