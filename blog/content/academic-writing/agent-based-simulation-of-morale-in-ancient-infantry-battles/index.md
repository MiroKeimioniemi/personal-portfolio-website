<p class="body-text">The Agent-Based NetLogo Simulation of Morale in Ancient Infantry Battles is a
significantly simplified, but surprisingly powerful model for investigating the
assumptions about the psychology and emergent behaviour of ancient armies in brutal
hand-to-hand combat on a massive scale that we can no longer properly relate to. The
observations in the results section support many commonly told stories of ancient
warfare. Breaking ranks is often the beginning of the end, training should focus equal
parts on skills and mental toughness, and strategic formations give a competitive edge,
while stretching too thin is detrimental.</p>

<p class="body-text">Skilled mercenaries can be highly effective, but they can be overcome by a group of truly
dedicated fighters whose morale exceeds their skills, provided they have some base
ability and the mercenaries are not highly motivated. Furthermore, sufficiently
intimidating the opponent force in the very beginning can win the battle already before
any physical contact. The mental aspect of ancient warfare can thus be just as strong of
a determinant of the outcomes of battles as any other.</p>
