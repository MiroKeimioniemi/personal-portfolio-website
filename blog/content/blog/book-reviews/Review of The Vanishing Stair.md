A good sequel to a great book with some very interesting plot twists that answer some of the questions from the first book while setting up a lot more for the third. Somehow, for some reason however, this book didn't really immerse me as well as the first one. It could be the fact that I got constantly distracted while reading or there might have been the typical sequel-effect at play or some kind of combination of those. However, at times, especially towards the end it was very gripping and quite intense. I like the occasionally "bouncy" writing style and I've grown to really like especially many of the side characters. The plot was satisfying although sometimes I felt that there were some pretty hasty solutions that were not quite as fulfilling. It did however manage to surprise me but rather by informing than hinting at things as this time I was just following Stevie around and letting the book explain the stuff to me as it unfolds. Again, could be just me and the lack of focus but I didn't really get the personal feeling of discovery but rather just an "Ohhhhh...". Although a lot happened in this one, after the halfway point at least, I feel that it was more sort of a bridge-book, a buildup to the third, which I now can't wait to get my hands on!

Obviously recommend it to all the people who have read Truly Devious and only those because well.. you need it for this one. The series itself I can recommend to anyone interested in light crime mysteries and a lot of drama that is actually pretty well written. Sometimes you might cringe at the characters but that's done on purpose so it's not just any cheap teen-drama. Do read Truly Devious and then continue it with this one, can't leave the mystery unsolved!
