A great collection of Cosmere "short" stories about very different but uniquely memorable characters in a wide variety of fantastical settings, each of which leaves you wanting more. I like how each story is very coherent with a tight set of implicit thematic questions that it explores almost systematically, while always leaving the reader with something to think about, such as the meaning of authenticity in "The Emperor's Soul" and whether we truly do get to control "progress" or not in "Sixth of the Dusk", both of which were my favorites along with "Mistborn: Secret History" due to its massive ramifications for the Cosmere as a whole.
