Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar is the perfect introduction to philosophy. It's educational, funny, inspiring and and despite the names of the philosophical concepts, quick, light and easy to read. It covers everything from metaphysics to epistemology (recommend for all IB-students for TOK!) to meta-philosophy in a very entertaining and concise way. Sometimes even a little too concise for my taste but then again, it's intended to be a light read to introduce people to the world of philosophy.

Who knew that philosophy and jokes would go this well together? Now afterwards it seems obvious. These concepts are often quite complex and they have a lot of depth to them but coupled with the right joke, anyone can grasp the essence of a concept in thirty seconds. In addition, a good, memorable joke really makes it stick. Even outside the jokes, the book is written with tongue in cheek, making it a very entertaining reading experience that believe it or not, leaves you even with some of the most influential philosophers' names too.

As I already said earlier, it's the perfect introduction to philosophy for anyone including children whose parents aren't too bothered by little dirty and dark humor. So I highly recommend it to essentially everyone! Also a great gift idea for basically anyone over the age of twelve ;)
