Straight to the point. It delivers what it promises: a kick in the ass. There's no shortcuts to realizing ones potential but the work has to be done and resistance must be beaten continuously, day after day.

The book is written very provocatively and thus not everything should be taken at face value but that combined with the short, concise nature of the book really serves the purpose of telling you what you already know deep down, phrasing it in clever ways to introduce new ways of thinking and above all, sending you to work. I am inspired.
