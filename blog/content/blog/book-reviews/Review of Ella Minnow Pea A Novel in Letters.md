A great book with a truly interesting catch! There are two factors that make it so unique: first, it is only written in letters and secondly but more importantly, the alphabetical letters used decrease throughout the book. Never have I ever agreed as much with the cover-quotes: this book is truly "a curiously compelling satire of human foibles, and a light-stepping commentary on censorship and totalitarianism" with "the whiff of a classic".

There are naturally some limitations to the storytelling because of these authorial choices but despite of them, the story is surprisingly gripping, immersing and even intense with interesting characters and excellent pacing paired with humor provided by the shortening letters and comical language, which the islanders are forced to use if they want to speak their mind.

Ella Minnow Pea is a light read and despite its slightly, to the modern teen, off-putting cover packs an interesting story that explores profound themes about freedom of speech and expression, betrayal, persistence, forgiveness, sensibility and chance among many others and tells it in a way one most likely has not encountered prior. In addition to all the language-enthusiasts, I would recommend it to everyone in need of a literary snack or just an honest story about people's adaptability.
