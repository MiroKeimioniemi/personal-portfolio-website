"Spark Joy" is a great book for a very specific audience. As Kondo herself says in the book, one should not read this book if they are not committed to the tidying process already beforehand. So keep that in mind when picking up the book. For those who are utterly lost or who are just interested in improving the efficiency of their storage space and -methods, the book serves as a great guide with very, and I mean VERY, detailed, concrete instructions and examples for every room, item category and storage space imaginable. However, these are not always universally applicable to which Kondo answers by encouraging creativity and assuring that with a little experimenting, one will find what works for them best.

The book does offer a lot of insight but a lot of it is not too groundbreaking or even new. Still, if you really do need a guide or some tips, I would argue that this book should get you through your tidying process from start to finish if you approach it the right way: as a tool. It packs some stories but I would not personally read it just to be entertained and so in order to get as much away from it as possible, one should start their tidying process and only consult the book when faced with questions. So, be careful not to read it as only procrastination material to "learn more" about "how to do it correctly" but instead just start tidying up and see if you even need the book.
