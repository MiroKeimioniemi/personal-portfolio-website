Read this one for school. It's an adequately interesting account of the evolution of the news industry with a lot of "behind-the-scenes stories", most of which are essentially just well-picked bad examples illustrating each topic. These were entertaining enough but what comes to the premise of navigating the world of fake news, it doesn't really provide any new insight nor does it reach a definite conclusion, which just makes it feel a bit like a memoir of the industry that has already seen its best days. Given that, it didn't really inspire me to get involved in, innovate about nor even read any more "legacy news" in the future either.

Might have been that I missed the point but after reading this book, I feel just indifferent.. mostly because I never saw the point the whole book was a setup for. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either. I can recommend it to someone who is really interested in the news industry but then again, I would at least hope that there are better alternatives.
