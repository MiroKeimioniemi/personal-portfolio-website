Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman discusses the two "systems" involved in thinking: the fast and automatic and the slow and deliberate. Both of this are capable of wonders but also highly consequential systematic errors on which the book focuses on. The takeaway message is that no matter how educated and confident you are, it's most likely that your intuition is and will always remain terrible at statistics and probabilities.

This is then illustrated with countless of examples where you get to test your own intuitions coupled with thorough explanations. Repetition truly is key as you can actually catch yourself making the mistakes as you learn to anticipate all the traps. Nevertheless, the book could be way more condensed. It was a demanding read as my attention often started wandering and finishing chapters before falling asleep was difficult at times. The content is great, especially the strategies and tips to fight against these heuristics and biases that the first 3/5 of the book spends on introducing but I was pretty exhausted already before reaching them.

I recommend the book to all people interested in improving their decision making and understanding the factors contributing to it. The lessons of the book can be applied across all professions and life situations but for most a really good summary of the book should about do it.
