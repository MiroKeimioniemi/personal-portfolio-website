A great book that brings the Ellingham case to a conclusion. It's a gripping and well written, light mystery-drama which I can honestly recommend to anyone with a piqued interest after that description. There is apparently a fourth instalment to the series, which I am now curious about even without any major cliff hangers thanks to the interesting and likeable characters with a tiny bit of mystery to each of them.
