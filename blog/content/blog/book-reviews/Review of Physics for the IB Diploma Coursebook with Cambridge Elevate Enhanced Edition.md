Double triple quadruple check everything you read and see. The book is filled with mistakes and inaccuracies and is often written very incomprehensibly overall. Explanations are often purely mathematical with variables defined tens of pages prior and no emphasis is put on building intuition. A lot is demanded of the reader and even then, it is basically impossible to understand everything necessary without the aid of YouTube and other internet resources.

That's what I thought initially anyway with my middle school physics background. AFTER I had made [extensive notes](https://ibdone1.wordpress.com/the-comprehensive-ib-physics-notes-for-2022-examinations-hl-and-sl/) of my own spending upwards of an hour on each page trying to decipher the "uninteresting algebra" Tsokos did not skip, the book became somewhat comprehensible. That is, given that you master IB physics already. Therefore it can be great for revising but not so much for studying for the first time... For both purposes I made my own comprehensive notes on every topic of the book the way I would have liked it to be. Those are available for free on ib-done.com. I would suggest you skip the book and consult those or try another book for studying. For revision however, the worked examples are perfect once you grasp all the contents.
