An interesting account on the 1980's Wall Street and Michael Lewis' own journey in Salomon Brothers with a pretty predictable teaching. Reading it here in 2021, it's naturally pretty outdated and none of the names in the book say anything to me. However, it is a nice peak into how making a ton of money doesn't necessarily translate into the greater good of a society. It is amazing to see how badly these companies are run and what kind of values are held high in those environments. Astonishing really. It really makes ones faith in the financial world tremble, so encouraging everyone after economic success to think for themselves about especially the motives of others.

When it comes to the writing of the book, it was quite jumpy and incoherent. Many interesting stories were put into motion but many of them, including the liar's poker itself were not even properly returned to. The stories and developments were interesting and gripping until it was branched yet again, which happens often, requiring you to get re-immersed to a new story. I would almost think of it as a collection of short stories about the financial world of through the 70's and 80's. That said, its relevance today is most likely diminished to most people but it is still fascinating for those interested in financial history were it about the instruments and events or the people of that era. The message of everything being kinda twisted and nasty is loud and clear but that should be present in newer books too.
