Reviewing books deeper into a series in a meaningful way, particularly when they are split into two parts, becomes in a way quite difficult and hence, in the interest of remaining entirely spoiler free I will keep this rather short. All I will say is that I can easily understand why this (both parts 1 and 2) is the highest rated book in all of Goodreads out of those with over 10 000 reviews. All of my praise for The Way of Kings applies but it gets still much better as now I can feel the real story beginning.

The first book got the characters to where they need to be and this one has them all finally cross paths in interesting ways under the setup for some truly massive future events. The atmosphere is anticipatory and even anxious but the tone is often quite funny even with the characters all having to get accustomed to each other in their new positions, which could be called the very theme of this first half. In fact, the theme of growing into new required, discovered and gifted roles runs so deep that almost every single one of the over 15 points of view forms its own story on the topic, each with their own unique problems and solutions, the interplay of which creates the conflicts of the larger plot. This is masterfully crafted and even a very major part of the worldbuilding extending all the way to the cultures, magic systems and peoples. I am purposefully trying to keep it vague to avoid spoilers but you will find it very satisfying finding out what I am talking about when reading this.

The Stormlight Archive just keeps on getting better. You already know I am going to recommend it to you regardless of what you normally read, even if that were nothing. As mentioned, you have to read The Way of Kings first obviously and even if you were somehow able to stop after it, which I highly doubt you would, you should absolutely continue with this as soon as possible. This is not a comment on the general Cosmere reading order as I am not yet qualified for that but even though my dear friend Aawez recommended reading Warbreaker in between, I could not resist the momentum and at least so far I have not found it to diminish my understanding and enjoyment of the story in any way - although an argument for enhancement might be made.
