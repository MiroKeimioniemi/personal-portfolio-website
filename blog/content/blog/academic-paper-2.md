This mathematical exploration examines the optimal timing for insulin injection to minimize glucose level variability after a meal.

## Abstract

Diabetes management requires careful timing of insulin administration relative to food intake. This study uses mathematical modeling to determine the optimal timing that minimizes postprandial glucose variability.

## Introduction

The relationship between insulin administration and glucose levels is complex and highly individualized.
