There once was a student on the IB\
tricked in by those older, who had yet to see\
what pain, what agony it'll bring thee\
who choose not to flee

each of them find the warning sign:\
What?! No free time?\
And so starts the cry:

"What do I do? I have no life. I still have my mocks and essays and other exams\
and IAs and IOs and EE and CAS and mocks again and..."

So it was prophesied:\
Only half of us will survive\
And like paralyzed birds on a branch\
