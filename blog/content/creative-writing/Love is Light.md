Love is light\
The world is revealed \
when it flickers in sight

Love is kind\
Warm summer evenings\
and a glass of fine wine

Love is right\
No matter what might\
for it is blind

Love is like the dawn\
at the end of the night

Love is dark\
It often corrupts\
and tears you apart

Love is dying\
For a cause that is Just\
or carefully maligned

Love is fighting\
over truth\
with lies

Love is like torture,\
involuntary\
and filled with fright

Love is both\
the dawn\
and the night
